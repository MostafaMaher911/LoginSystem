I designed a user registration and account creation page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring a smooth user experience. HTML was used to structure the form elements, while CSS was employed to style the page, making it responsive across various devices. JavaScript was integrated to enable real-time validation, ensuring that the email and password fields are correctly filled before submission. The goal was to create a user-friendly and secure interface for new account creation.
